# Constitutional Cyber Defense Platform (CCDP)

## 1. Overview

The Constitutional Cyber Defense Platform (CCDP) is a distributed, autonomous security system designed to detect, evaluate, and respond to cyber threats while enforcing immutable governance constraints. CCDP combines AI-driven detection, cryptographic attestation, Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus, and policy-as-constitution enforcement to ensure that no defensive action occurs without legitimacy, auditability, and compliance.

Unlike traditional SOAR or SIEM systems, CCDP assumes:
- Partial system compromise is inevitable
- AI models may fail or be adversarially influenced
- No single authority is trustworthy
- Compliance is a first-class runtime concern

CCDP is built to survive hostile environments, including nation-state threat models.
